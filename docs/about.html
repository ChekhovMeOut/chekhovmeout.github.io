                    <h4>
                        I grew up in the New York metro area in a business-oriented family. I realized my passion for the sciences at a young age by asking endless questions about the world around us. That curiosity has stuck, and ultimately led me to study a combined Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry degree at Northeastern University.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        The undergraduate program at Northeastern challenged me to grow as both an individual and an engineer. I am sincerely grateful for all 156 credit hours spent in the classroom and nearly 2 years of co-op. The combination of work and study gave me immediate opportunities to apply classwork at interesting companies across the United States. After graduating in 2024, I am exceedingly confident this educational path was the right choice for me. I then took a leap of faith and relocated to Huntsville, Alabama for my next position.

                        I am looking for the next challenging role in my early career. I am comfortable in both manufacturing and research environments. I recognize that teams of every scale, from multinationals to startups, require diversity and cohesion to perform their best. I personally find in-person mentorship to be worth its weight in gold.

                        I am looking for a demanding role at an energy, chemical, or EPC firm. I have a particular interest in control theory, materials science, and reaction kinetics. In addition to these interests, I'm aware of how much I have yet to explore.
