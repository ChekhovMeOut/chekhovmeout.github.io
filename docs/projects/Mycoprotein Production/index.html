                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Northeastern University requires undergraduates to complete a capstone design project. For chemical engineers, this
                    means working in a team to create a comprehensive process design per an assigned category. Our design prompt was:
                    sustainably produce edible protein alternatives using microbial fermentation.
                </p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    The global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. However, the need for sustainable and plentiful protein
                    sources to feed this new generation remains woefully unmet. As of 2019, there were approximately 150 million cases of
                    profound protein malnutrition. Traditional animal husbandry is unlikely to meet this need due to its intensive water
                    consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GGE), and land usage. Producing mycoprotein via microbial fermentation has
                    emerged as a promising method to reduce carbon footprint while addressing global nutritional needs. Some successful
                    commercialization ventures currently exist; however, industrial processes must be improved to increase cost
                    competitiveness to drive widespread adoption.
                </p>

                <h3>A Novel Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Current industrial processes use a refined sugar (typically glucose) feedstock to provide the caloric energy for
                    sustaining
                    microbes. This is already a massive improvement towards sustainability compared to the incidental emissions of
                    husbandry. However, we sought to use an agricultural waste product as our feedstock in order to radically reduce
                    production costs and GGE footprint. This technique has been demonstrated to great success in similar industries like
                    bioethanol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ultimately conceived of the idea to use a totally novel feedstock for this application - coffee silver skins
                    (CSS). CSS is released in a dry, papery particles as coffee beans are roasted. It has several advantages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waste feedstocks typically dirty and impure by the very nature of them being waste. CSS, however, is the sole
                        byproduct of its unit operation. It is exceptionally pure and suitable for batch control. This addresses one of
                        the greatest
                        challenges in renewable bioprocessing: repeatability.</li>
                    <li>It is rich with cellulose and hemicellulose polymers, which
                        are the ultimate source of sugars for saccharification and subsequent fermentation.</li>
                    <li>CSS costs nothing, maybe even
                        less. Producers are currently saddled with disposal cost, who would happily sell it for low or no cost. It is
                        produced at scale. Our estimates predict at least 8,300 tons are produced in the US annually.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although saccharification of CSS has been discussed academically and mycoprotein production occurs commercially, the
                    combination of these two technologies are, to the best of my knowledge, unexplored.
                </p>
                                    
                <h3>Development & Deliverables</h3>
                <p>
                    Our team met several times throughout the week on both a scheduled and emergent basis. Tasks were assigned and
                    tracked in a Gantt chart. Weekly memos were used to inform our stakeholders and track upcoming deliverables, tasks,
                    and roadblocks. We met with industry professionals to refine our understand of the economic and technological
                    landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in delivering both an experimental and computational proof of concept. Our background research,
                    economic analysis, and proof of concept culminated in a public symposium presentation and final report. We
                    ultimately found a plant at our proposed scale was not economically feasible. There are, however, plenty of
                    opportunities to improve experimental and computational methods which may ultimately reverse this conclusion.
                </p>
