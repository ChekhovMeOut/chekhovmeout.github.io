                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 with the goal of making spaceflight
                    accessible to everyone. As a unique aerospace company with sites all across the United States, it
                    seeks to radically reduce the cost of access to space with bold, manufacturing-first operational
                    approaches. At its Huntsville, AL location, Blue Origin essentially a blank canvas; it has since
                    transformed to regularly launching its suborbital New Shepard rocket and more recently, the
                    heavy-lift New Glenn rocket.
                </p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                    My responsibilities were to innovate, streamline, and support chemical processing operations at the
                    engine manufacturing facility. Specifically, I specialized in cleaning, passivation, and
                    verification (CPV) operations. My daily tasks included analyzing salt and process delays, reviewing
                    test results, and making recommendations intended to focus mostly on the momentous BE-4 engine which
                    generates over half a million pounds of thrust. The engine was also under the most scheduling
                    pressure, which gave me real-time opportunities to see the effects of quality control on an
                    extremely precise process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of my major projects was to use statistical process control (SPC) to improve throughput and
                    decrease variations in the process. First, I improved workflows over a documentation to reduce
                    redundancy, decrease variability, and improve batch traceability. I then developed a
                    proof-of-concept to continually assess performance based on historical CPV operations from these
                    workflows. The enabled rigorous analysis of our process stability and capability where I could
                    identify critical gaps in our process control for different allowable criteria.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another major responsibility of this role was to perform audits on both internal and external
                    systems, including calibration maintenance projects and inventory chain issues involving the
                    development of ideal acid (HCl) operating capabilities. Externally, I performed supplier audits on
                    Blue Origin's "special processes," some of which regularly deal with Hydrazine and Ammonia. I found
                    it particularly interesting to observe the complex yet critical dynamic between all the involved
                    parties â€“ sourcing manufacturing engineers, quality control, supplier technicians, supply chain, and
                    MRO engineers.
                </p>

                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>
                    I was pleased with both a wonderful mentor and supervisor at BO. They felt more everyone at the
                    company truly and deeply believed in the value of space accessibility. However, the company has
                    experienced some growing pains during the transition from a small research organization to a
                    profit-driven manufacturing company. This unfortunately led to challenges for employees,
                    particularly through a reduction in which I was affected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was admittedly disappointed that this opportunity for which I had relocated just 4 months ago, was
                    abruptly cut short. I am still grateful for the professional development and connections I made
                    during my time at Blue. The flexible pace of manufacturing was fascinating and rewarding to be a
                    part of.
                </p>
